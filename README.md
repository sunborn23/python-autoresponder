### Manual Usage

For testing purposes you can run the script from the shell. To do so, navigate to the project directory and run 

    python3 run_autoresponder.py

If you want to run the script multiple times with different configurations on each executions, 
you can achieve that by running

    python3 run_autoresponder.py --config-path /the/path/to/your/config/file/autoresponder.config.ini

### Usage as a cronjob

For production use you can configure it as a cronjob.

From the shell, run:

	crontab -e

Then append to the file (replace "/the/path/to/the/project/folder" by the actual path to these files):

	*/1 * * * * python3 /the/path/to/the/project/folder/run_autoresponder.py

This will run the script every minute.
